title: Invoking and Creating Contracts with Stellar Transactions
---

Stellar supports invoking and deploying contracts with a new Operation named `InvokeHostFunctionOp`. The [`soroban-cli`] abstracts these details away from the user, but SDKs do not yet and if you're building a dapp you'll probably find yourself building the XDR transaction to submit to the network.

The `InvokeHostFunctionOp` can be used to perform the following Soroban operations:

- Invoke contract functions.
- Install WASM of the new contracts.
- Deploy new contracts using the installed WASM or built-in implementations (this currently includes only the [token contract](./stellar-asset-contract.mdx)).

[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli

## InvokeHostFunctionOp

The XDR of `HostFunction` and `InvokeHostFunctionOp` below can be found
[here][XDR].

[XDR]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/df18148747e807618acf4639db41c4fd6f0be9fc/Stellar-transaction.x#L554-L563

```c++
union HostFunction switch (HostFunctionType type)
{
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT:
    SCVec invokeArgs;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT:
    CreateContractArgs createContractArgs;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INSTALL_CONTRACT_CODE:
    InstallContractCodeArgs installContractCodeArgs;
};

struct InvokeHostFunctionOp
{
    // The host function to invoke
    HostFunction function;
    // The footprint for this invocation
    LedgerFootprint footprint;
    // Per-address authorizations for this host fn
    // Currently only supported for INVOKE_CONTRACT function
    ContractAuth auth<>;
};
```

### Function

The `function` in `InvokeHostFunctionOp` will be executed by the Soroban host environment. The function arguments are passed as function-dependent XDR. The options are:

1. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT`
   - This will call the `call_n` host function, invoking a contract function.
   - `invokeArgs` is expected to contain the contract id, contract function name, and the parameters to the contract function being invoked.
2. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INSTALL_CONTRACT_CODE`
   - This will install the contract WASM using the provided `code` blob:
   ```c++
   struct InstallContractCodeArgs
   {
       opaque code<SCVAL_LIMIT>;
   };
   ```
3. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT`
   - This will create a contract instance in the network using the specified `source` and build a 32-byte contract identifer based on `contractID` value.
   ```c++
    struct CreateContractArgs
    {
       ContractID contractID;
       SCContractCode source;
    };
   ```
   - `source` can be either a reference to the hash of the installed WASM (to be more precise, a SHA-256 hash of the `InstallContractCodeArgs` from the operation above) or just specify that a built-in contract has to be used:
     ```c++
     union SCContractCode switch (SCContractCodeType type)
     {
     case SCCONTRACT_CODE_WASM_REF:
         Hash wasm_id;
     case SCCONTRACT_CODE_TOKEN:
         void;
     };
     ```

- `contractID` is defined as following:
  ```c++
  union ContractID switch (ContractIDType type)
  {
  case CONTRACT_ID_FROM_SOURCE_ACCOUNT:
      uint256 salt;
  case CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY:
      struct
      {
          uint256 key;
          Signature signature;
          uint256 salt;
      } fromEd25519PublicKey;
  case CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET:
      Asset asset;
  };
  ```
- The parameters of this value define which the hash preimage that is then hashed with SHA-256 to get the ID of the created contract.
- `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_SOURCE_ACCOUNT` specifies that the contract ID will be created using the Stellar source account and the provided salt. The contract ID preimage used is [`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID_FROM_SOURCE_ACCOUNT`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/026c9cd074bdb28ddde8ee52f2a4502d9e518a09/Stellar-transaction.x#L643-L649).
- `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET` specifies that the contract will be created using the Stellar asset. This is only supported when `source == SCCONTRACT_CODE_TOKEN`. Note, that the asset doesn't need to exist when this is applied, however the issuer of the asset will be the initial token administrator. The contract ID preimage used is [`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/026c9cd074bdb28ddde8ee52f2a4502d9e518a09/Stellar-transaction.x#L637-L642).
- `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY` specified that the contract will be created using a public ED25519 key. Since this operation is not tied to any on-chain entity, this also has to contain an ED25519 signature of SHA256 hash of [`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_ARGS`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/026c9cd074bdb28ddde8ee52f2a4502d9e518a09/Stellar-transaction.x#L650-L656) XDR preimage. The contract ID preimage used is [`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ED25519`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/026c9cd074bdb28ddde8ee52f2a4502d9e518a09/Stellar-transaction.x#L623-L629).

### Footprint

The footprint must contain the `LedgerKeys` that will be read and/or written. More information about the footprint can be found in the advanced section of [interacting with contracts](../learn/interacting-with-contracts#storage-footprint-and-preflight).

### Authorization Data

This is currently only supported for `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT`.

Soroban [authorization framework](../learn/authorization.mdx) provides a
standardized way for passing authorization data to the contract invocations via
`ContractAuth` structures.

```c++
struct AddressWithNonce
{
    SCAddress address;
    uint64 nonce;
};

struct ContractAuth
{
    AddressWithNonce* addressWithNonce; // not present for invoker
    AuthorizedInvocation rootInvocation;
    SCVec signatureArgs;
};
```

`ContractAuth` contains a tree of invocations authorized by an `Address` and
the corresponding signature (in `Address`-dependent format).

In order to build a `ContractAuth` the following is required:

- `Address` that authorizes the invocations and the corresponding `nonce`.
  - When `addressWithNonce` is missing, then it means that the transaction
  source account (or operation source when present) authorizes these 
  invocations. `signatureArgs` have to be skipped as well in this case.
  - `nonce` has to correspond to the `contractID` of the `rootInvocation`. It
  is stored in the ledger entry with `CONTRACT_DATA` key with `contractID` from
  `rootInvocation` and `SCVal` `key` with the following value:
  `ScVal::Object(Some(ScObject::NonceKey(address)))`.
- `rootInvocation` structure corresponding to the authorized invocation tree
- `signatureArgs` - signature (or multiple signatures) that sign the 32-byte
payload that is a SHA-256 hash of `ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_AUTH` preimage
([XDR][envelope-xdr]). The signature structure is defined by the `Address` (see
below for the Stellar account signatures). This should be empty if 
`addressWithNonce` is not present (as transaction/operation signature is used
instead).

`AuthorizedInvocation` defines a node in the authorized invocation tree:

```c++
struct AuthorizedInvocation
{
    Hash contractID;
    SCSymbol functionName;
    SCVec args;
    AuthorizedInvocation subInvocations<>;
};
```

`AuthorizedInvocation` needs to include a contract, contract function, arguments
of `require_auth`/`require_auth_for_args` call and all the authorized
sub-contract invocations originating from the current node. Building 
`AuthorizedInvocation` trees may be simplified by using the recording auth mode
in Soroban preflight (see the [docs][preflight-doc] for more details).

#### Stellar Account Signatures

`signatureArgs` format is user-defined for the [custom accounts], but it is
protocol-defined for the Stellar accounts.

The signatures for the Stellar account are a vector of the following Soroban
[structures] in the Soroban SDK format:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct AccountEd25519Signature {
    pub public_key: BytesN<32>,
    pub signature: BytesN<64>,
}
```
